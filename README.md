## 1. ILP
Example of integer linear program.
Implementation of a program that takes the vector of personnal demand for each hour and outputs the optimal allocation of personnal.

## 2. Network Flows
Implementation of Ford-Fulkerson (Edmons-Karp) algorithm.
Procedure for obtaining an initial feasible flow in networks with non-zero lower bounds. Using this flow as the initial flow for the Ford-Fulkerson (Edmons-Karp) algorithm. 
Solved Survey Design problem as the Maximum Flow Problem.

## 3. Minimum Cost Flows
Reconstruction of binary images using network flows.
Implementation of LP formulation of Minimal Cost Flow Problem used for reconstructing binary image.

## 4. Traveling Salesman problem
Implementation of a program that solves the image unshredding problem using TSP with lazy constraints.
