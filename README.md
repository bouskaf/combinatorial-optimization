## 2. Network Flows
Implementation of Ford-Fulkerson (Edmons-Karp) algorithm.
Procedure for obtaining an initial feasible flow in networks with non-zero lower bounds. Using this flow as the initial flow for the Ford-Fulkerson (Edmons-Karp) algorithm. 
Solved Survey Design problem as the Maximum Flow Problem.

## 3. Minimum Cost Flows

## 5. Scheduling and the Branch and Bound algorithm
Implementation of Bratley’s algorithm. The input is given by three vectors — processing time, release time and deadline. The output assignment of tasks to start times in an optimal schedule minimizing the makespan.
